# Task 8 – Brute Force Attack using DVWA

## Objective
To understand and demonstrate a brute force attack using a vulnerable web application in a controlled environment.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Docker
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

## Description
A brute force attack attempts multiple username and password combinations until correct credentials are found. DVWA provides a legal environment to practice such attacks.

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Docker on Kali Linux
2. Deployed DVWA using Docker
3. Configured DVWA database
4. Set security level to Low
5. Performed brute force attack using weak credentials

## Result
The login was successfully bypassed using weak username and password combinations.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the importance of strong passwords and proper security controls to prevent brute force attacks.
